©ANNOUNCER EXPRESS NEWSPAPER, MONDAY, OCTOBER 17, 2022.</h2><br><br>
<p>No fewer than 50 Agricultural Extension Officers in Imo State have been trained on extension tools, methodology and selected Agricultural value chains viz; Oil palm, maize and cassava by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development in collaboration with the National Agricultural Extension and Research Liaison Services (NAERLS) and SASAKAWA-AFRIVA ASSOCIATION/GLOBAL 2000, aimed at increased food productivity.<br><br>
The event, which was flagged off by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and held simultaneously in the 36 States of Federation, including Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja took place at the lmo Agricultural Development Programme  headquarters, Owerri, last week from October 12 through October 14 2022, featuring stakeholders from the Agricultural Sector, Agricultural experts, Non-Governmental Organizations, the State and Local Government Ministry’s extension workers, among others.<br><br>
While declaring open the training session, the State Commissioner for Agriculture, Dr Bartholomew Okorochukwu said, that the capacity training would expose the trainees to the modern method of Agricultural practices and extension service delivery.The Commissioner assured that the State Government has capable extension officers that would facilitate seamless transfer of the acquired skills to the grassroots farmers and value-chain processors in achieving sustainable Development Goals and promised that State will continue to collaborate with the Federal Government towards enhancing food production in the State.<br><br>
In his remarks, the representative of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development from Federal Department of Agriculutral Extension, Owerri, Mr Nnanna Ugochukwu, explained that the training is targeted at reducing post harvest losses as well as achieving food security in the country. He further stated that the training was held simultaneously in all 36 States of the Federation, including FCT, to train Extension workers across the Country, so they will become more effective, efficient to be able to transfer the knowledge being propagated by the Ministry to the rural farmers for increased productivity and livelihood of farmers.<br><br>
He, therefore, urged the State Government to complement the Federal Government efforts by ensuring the programme gets to the rural farmers towards meeting the target of the Federal Government in ensuring food security and increased food productivity, especially by funding the State ADP in carrying out such grassroots responsibilities.He contended that as diverse as Nigeria's problem, especially, in Agriculutral sector, there was need for each level of Government tier to assist in realizing a desired goal of increased food productivity in the country.<br><br>
In his own, the State Director from the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Christian Iwuchukwu who presented  the welcome address of the Federal Director, charged participants to be serious and pay attention to what was being taught so that they would make a positive impact in the life of farmers.<br><br>
A Resource person at the event, Chief Celestine Anaele, who doubles as Owerri and Orlu zonal Manager of Imo ADP, took the participants on Oil palm production and exposed them to the knowledge of what he described as three main types of Oil palm viz; Dura, Pisifera and Tenera, explaining that the generally and most accepted oil plantation is Tenera which he said is a crossbreed of both Dura and Pisifera species.Chief Anaele expressed optimism that the participants at the end of the programme will be able to step down the knowledge to the local farmers, especially on the modern method of farming, especially on improving oil palm production. <br><br>
Earlier, the lmo State Coordinator of the programme and ADP staff, Mrs Henrietta Nzurumike, disclosed that the training which was the 3rd Batch of 50 lmo Extension Workers, was organised to train the Extension workers on modern methods of three value chain of Oil palm production, maize farming and cassava production, which she noted have comparative advantage.Mrs Nzurumike explained that the programme featured different resource persons who took the participants on both theory and practicals, where the participants were expected to do a step-down training, geared towards increased food production in the State and country at large and urged participants to take such Federal government gesture very serious.<br><br>
She noted that  Federal Government had taken 30 and 40 participants in the 1st and 2nd batches of the programme in the past, hence, the 3rd batch with 50 participants, where, the participants were issued Certificates of participation at the end of the exercise.
Nzurumike further described the programme as a laudable project with positive impact on local farmers cutting across Government and private Agriculutral bodies, noting that the more Agriculutral Extension farmers were equipped, the more the local farmers also receive improved farming techniques and the more improved food production,expressing  optimism that the training will yield much dividends in due course.<br><br>
